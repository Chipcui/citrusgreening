<br>
<b>Diaci1.1</b> is the current version of the <i>Diaphorina citri</i> genome. The contig N50 for this assembly is 38 kb. It was submitted to NCBI and called NCBI-diaci1.1. You can access it <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000475195.1/">here</a>. It was annotated with the NCBI <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process">Gnomon pipeline</a>. This is the version available within WebApollo. 
<br>
<br>
The Maker annotations from the <b>Diaci1.0</b> version of the genome have also been mapped to the current version. The mapping program looked for exact matches between the two assemblies, accounting for stretches of the assembly that were converted to N’s. It created an ‘alignment file’, which was used to perform the re-mapping of features in gff3 format. Maker annotations that mapped to sequence that did not exist in <b>Diaci1.1</b> or only contained N’s in the NCBI-approved assembly were discarded. The Maker annotations that were on retained sequence were preserved in their original format, except for their location (scaffold name, coordinates, and strand if appropriate). 37 Maker gene models from <b>Diaci1.0</b> did <u>not</u> map to <b>Diaci1.1</b>. Both the Maker annotations and NCBI annotations are available as evidence in Web Apollo.

<b>Training</b>
<br>
There are many training resources available. Monica Munoz-Torres has put together a comprehensive <a href="http://genomearchitect.org/web_apollo_user_guide">guide on the manual curation</a> process. A recent version of her training slides can be found <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MonicaMunozTorres/apollo-introduction-for-the-chestnut-research-community">here</a>. Monica Poelchau at NAL created a <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/content/blast-tutorial">tutorial</a> for the new BLAST interface.

    <li>You can access <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/webapp/blast/">BLAST</a> and the <a href="https://apollo.nal.usda.gov/diacit/jbrowse/">JBrowse genome browser</a> for these (and other) genomes under the 'Tools' drop-down menu from the <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/">i5k Workspace homepage</a>.</li>
    <li>The data files for annotation are available on the <a href="ftp://ftp.citrusgreening.org/annotation/curated_orthologs/">FTP site</a>.
</ul>
<br>
We plan to use <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/content/rules-web-apollo-annotation-i5k-pilot-project">annotation rules</a> adapted from the i5k pilot. The annotators will use the replaced models field to state what model they are replacing with each annotation.  Monica Poelchau at the NAL created the following <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/web-apollo-replaced-models-field-explanations-and-examples">guide</a> to explain the rationale and details of this process.

If required, the <i>Diaphorina citri</i> data that <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/">National Agricultural Library</a> hosts can be downloaded from <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/data/Arthropoda/diacit-%28Diaphorina_citri%29/">here</a>. The Maker annotations re-mapped to the NCBI-diaci1.1 assembly are available <a href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Maker_v1.1-Primary_Gene_Set-NCBI.tgz">here</a>.
